//! This module provides MQTT primitives for library-agnostic message handling.
//!
//! These types represent the fundamental building blocks of MQTT communication, such as publishing,
//! subscribing, and managing QoS levels. They serve as a common interface that can be adapted or
//! converted to the specific types used by any MQTT client library.
//!
//! # Purpose
//!
//! The types in this module are designed to be the lowest common denominator of MQTT functionality,
//! ensuring compatibility across various MQTT client libraries. By abstracting these core MQTT concepts,
//! this module allows for greater flexibility and modularity in MQTT-based applications.
//!
//! Users of the homie5 library are expected to convert these types into the corresponding types of their chosen
//! MQTT client library when performing actual MQTT operations.
//!
//! # Primitives
//!
//! The module includes:
//!
//! - `Publish`: Represents a publish message, including the topic, payload, QoS level, and retain flag.
//! - `Subscription`: Represents a subscription to a specific MQTT topic with a defined QoS level.
//! - `Unsubscribe`: Represents a request to unsubscribe from a topic.
//! - `LastWill`: Represents the "Last Will" message used to notify others in case of unexpected disconnection.
//! - `QoS`: Represents the three levels of Quality of Service in MQTT (AtMostOnce, AtLeastOnce, ExactlyOnce).
//!
//! These primitives form the backbone of MQTT communication and can be converted to their equivalents in
//! various MQTT libraries, making this module a flexible foundation for MQTT client implementations.
